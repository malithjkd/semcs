# Introduction

In this project we try to intergrate raspberry pi pico w based extantion ecosystem to HomeAssistat. The ystem which measure and analyse air conditions and contol limited number of scoket outlets to achive specific tasks. 

Stage 1
Measure humidity, co2 level, PM2.5 and recode to text files. 
Iteractive web based interface to display variations take dicitions accodingly.

Stage 2 
Control remote controller to operate AC and fan. 

Stage 3
Identify confort levels and try to control the AC to meet required values. 

Stage 4
